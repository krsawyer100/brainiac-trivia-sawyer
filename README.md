## Project Description

The Brainiac Trivia Game is a web application that has multiple categories to choose from in order to play different trivia quizzes. This project was initially create as a school coding assignment where I had to develop a React Web Application with the following parameters: use a datebase solution, link two types of data together, perform CRUD operations with data, and use NextJS API routes. I decided to create a trivia game due to my personal love for trivia quizzes but found many trivia games to be too overwhelming visually for me to enjoy.

## Features

1. Multiple Trivia categories and questions
2. Create an account, login, or logout
3. View highscores linked to users account per category
4. Delete a highscore by category linked to users account

## Tech Stack

### Languages/Libraries:

1. JavaScript
2. CSS
3. MongoDB
4. React
5. Next.JS

### NPM Packages:

1. bcrypt
2. html-react-parser
3. iron-session
4. mongoose
5. next
6. react
7. react-dom
8. eslint
9. eslint-config-next

### External APIs:

1. OpenTriviaDB (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

## Environmental Variables Required:

1. IRON_PASS
2. MONGODB_URI

## Future Project Implementations

1. Incorporate a timer into the trivia games to make it more fun
2. Create db schema of categories and their id's to be able to more effectively link photos for css purpose to them and other useful applications throughout the application.
3. Revamp the css through the application to make the game more visually engaging and more mobile responsive.

## Notes

At this time, I have not completed the css for the application, especially the mobile queries due to time constraints and ensuring the CRUD operations and functionality were complete.
